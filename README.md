Business Objective:
        Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments.
Finding the potential customers by analysing the behaviour of them is useful to understand the targeted customers.    
For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the companyâ€™s database, a company can analyse which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

After exploring the data and changing it according to our need we applied the model on both kmeans and hierarchical clustering and picked the best model with the help of evaluation techniques.
Then we removed some insights from the data and deployed it with the help of streamlit framework.
